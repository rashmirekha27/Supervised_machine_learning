# Supervised Machine Learning Challenge - Predicting Credit Risk

In this assignment, I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 
I used this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans and will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
Retrieved the data From the Resources folder `lending_data.csv`,Import the data using Pandas. Created and compared two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier.
